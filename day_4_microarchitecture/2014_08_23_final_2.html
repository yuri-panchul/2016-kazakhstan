5.2 What kind of delay is illustrated on the picture below (marked by "?")?

a) Clock-to-Q Propagation delay:
tpcq = time after clock edge that the output Q is guaranteed to be stable (i.e., to stop changing)

b) Clock-to-Q Contamination delay:
tccq = time after clock edge that Q might be unstable (i.e., start changing)

c) Skew: difference between two clock edges. The clock doesn’t arrive at all registers at same time

<img width=500 src="delay_clock_to_q_propagation.png">

6.2 What kind of timing constraint is illustrated on the picture below (marked by "?")?

a) Setup time: tsetup = time before clock edge data must be stable (i.e. not changing)

b) Hold time: thold = time after clock edge data must be stable

c) Aperture time: ta = time around clock edge data must be stable (ta = tsetup +  thold)

d) Tc = minimum and maximum delays between registers

7.2 What kind of cache is shown on the picture?

a) Fully associative cache

b) Direct cache

c) Two-way cache

11.2 Which rule for signal assignment is violated in the following code?

a) Synchronous sequential logic: use always @(posedge clk) or always_ff @(posedge clk)
and nonblocking assignments (<=)    

        always_ff @ (posedge clk)
		   q <= d; // nonblocking

b) Simple combinational logic: use continuous assignments (assign…)

             assign y = a & b; 

c) More complicated combinational logic: use always @* or always_comb and blocking assignments (=)

d) Assign a signal in only one always statement or continuous assignment statement

e) This code does not violate any rules for signal assignment

    input              clk,
